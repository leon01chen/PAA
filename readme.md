# Princeton Alumni Angels Data Analysis


This data analysis project was started in the summer of 2021 in an effort to gather and analyze relevant information about PAA's startup pipeline and comparing it to the portfolio that the group is currently invested in.

There is a particular focus on the diversity metrics (gender, race/ethnicity) of all the startups that have applied to PAA and comparing it to the startup/VC industry as a whole. PAA prides itself in screening strong and innovative startups that are diverse in nature - this analysis serves as a "checkup" to see just how well (or poorly) the group is doing in following this statement.

You can read all about why and how diverse startups are great for idea and revenue generation here (and great for investors' returns too!):

As an angel investing community built off of the strength of the Princeton alumni network, perhaps the group does have some sense of responsibility in propelling great startups that are diverse in nature towards higher series funding. Notice how the metrics for venture capital funding for startups is lacking for startups with more diverse teams:

and how the diversity metrics within the venture capital industry itself seemingly mimic the funding metrics:

We hope this analysis continues in the future as PAA grows its network of investors and startups, allowing for a more rigorous analysis.
