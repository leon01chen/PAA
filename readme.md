# Princeton Alumni Angels Data Analysis


This data analysis project was started in the summer of 2021 by Leon Chen '23 and Asher Joy '23 in an effort to gather and analyze relevant information about PAA's startup pipeline and comparing it to the portfolio that the group is currently invested in.

There is a particular focus on the diversity metrics (gender, race/ethnicity) of all the startups that have applied to PAA and comparing it to the startup/VC industry as a whole. PAA prides itself in screening strong and innovative startups that are diverse in nature - this analysis serves as a "checkup" to see just how well (or poorly) the group is doing in following this statement.

We hope this analysis continues in the future as PAA grows its network of investors and startups, allowing for a more rigorous analysis.
